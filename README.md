# Fynitude
A library of reusable widgets for [Fyne v2](https://fyne.io/), the Golang GUI toolkit

## Widgets

### Dynamic Select
This widget allows the list of options to be refreshed dynamically when opened. The default Fyne Select widget only supports a predefined list. With this Dynamic Select widget, you can trigger a list refresh on demand.

### Tappable Image
This widget triggers a custom event when clicked. Unfortunately, the default Fyne Image widget is not clickable.
